| 1   | comet-ml/opik          | An open-source LLM evaluation tool used to debug, evaluate, monitor LLM applications, RAG systems, and agentic workflows with comprehensive tracing, automated evaluations, and production-ready dashboards.                 | https://github.com/comet-ml/opik     |
| 2   | FlexOlmo  | With FlexOlmo, data owners can contribute to the development of a language model without giving up control of their data. Thereâ€™s no need to share raw data directly, and data contributors can decide when their data is active in the model (i.e., who can make use of it and when), deactivate data at any time, and receive attributions whenever data is used for inference.                 | https://allenai.org/blog/flexolmo     |
